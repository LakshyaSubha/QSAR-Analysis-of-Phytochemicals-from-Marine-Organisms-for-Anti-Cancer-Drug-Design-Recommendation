QSAR Analysis of Phytochemicals from Marine Organisms for Anti-Cancer Drug Design Recommendation
 Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) study focused on phytochemicals derived from marine organisms. The project investigates their potential as anti-cancer drug candidates through a combination of statistical modeling, molecular descriptor analysis, and computational evaluation. By identifying key molecular features influencing biological activity, this research supports data-driven drug design and prioritization of marine compounds for future pharmacological exploration.
 Research Objective
The primary goal of this study is to develop predictive QSAR models that correlate physicochemical and topological molecular descriptors with anti-cancer activity. The results aim to assist in selecting promising marine-derived phytochemicals for anti-cancer drug development and optimization.
Methodology
1.	Dataset Preparation:
Phytochemicals from marine organisms were compiled and standardized for QSAR analysis.
2.	Descriptor Calculation:
Physicochemical, topological, and quantum chemical descriptors were computed using cheminformatics tools.
3.	Model Development:
  Simple and multiple linear regression (MLR) models were constructed.
  Feature combinations were screened to avoid multicollinearity (correlation > 0.85).	Statistical parameters such as R², Adjusted R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and p-values were used for   performance evaluation.
4.	Model Evaluation:
The models were validated through statistical significance tests to ensure predictive reliability.
Top-performing models were identified based on high Adjusted R² and low MSE values.
5.	Interpretation and Recommendation:
Descriptors with consistent significance were interpreted as key determinants for anti-cancer potential.
These findings guided the recommendation of lead compounds for further in vitro and in silico validation.
